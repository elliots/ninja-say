ninja-say
======

A text to speech driver for NinjaBlocks.

### Usage

Just send it a string. Anything you send will be read out in a ninja* voice.

* That's probably not true. Hard to say because ninjas don't talk. They only kill.

### Installation

#### Mac
Uses the built-in 'say' program. Should work out of the box.

#### Linux
Uses 'espeak'. You may need to install it using
```sudo apt-get install espeak```

#### Windows
Uses 'espeak'. You can download it from [http://sourceforge.net/projects/espeak/files/espeak/espeak-1.47/espeak-1.47.11-win.zip/download](http://sourceforge.net/projects/espeak/files/espeak/espeak-1.47/espeak-1.47.11-win.zip/download). Then add it's installed location to ```PATH```.
